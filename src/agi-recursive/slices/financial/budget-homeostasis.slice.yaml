  # Budget Homeostasis Framework

  ## Core Principle
  A budget system functions identically to biological homeostasis:
  - SET POINT: Target budget limit (e.g., R$5,000/month)
  - SENSOR: Transaction monitoring system
  - CORRECTOR: Spending reduction mechanism
  - DISTURBANCE: Unexpected expenses or impulse purchases

  ## Homeostatic Loop
  ```
  Spending Increase → Sensor Detects → Gap Calculated → Corrector Activated → Spending Reduced
  ```

  ## Failure Modes

  ### No Corrector (Budget Diabetes)
  - Glucose spike → No insulin → Hyperglycemia
  - Spending spike → No intervention → Debt

  ### Delayed Feedback
  - Slow sensor → Late detection → Overshoot
  - Monthly statements → Delayed awareness → Budget overrun

  ### Set Point Drift
  - Body adjusts to high baseline → New normal
  - Lifestyle inflation → Budget expansion → New "normal"

  ## Regulatory Mechanisms

  ### Negative Feedback (Stabilizing)
  - TRIGGER: Spending exceeds 80% of limit
  - ACTION: Reduce discretionary spending
  - GOAL: Return to set point

  ### Positive Feedback (Destabilizing - AVOID)
  - Stress → Emotional spending → More debt → More stress → MORE spending
  - THIS IS A VICIOUS CYCLE - needs circuit breaker

  ## Implementation

  ### 1. Define Set Point
  - Monthly budget limit (e.g., R$5,000)
  - Category limits (food: R$1,500, transport: R$500)

  ### 2. Install Sensor
  - Real-time transaction tracking
  - Daily balance checks
  - Category spending alerts

  ### 3. Configure Corrector
  - Automatic spending freeze at 90% threshold
  - Pre-approved alternative behaviors (e.g., cook instead of delivery)
  - Weekly review and adjustment

  ### 4. Handle Disturbances
  - Emergency fund (buffer for unexpected expenses)
  - Flexible category allocation (borrow from savings, not credit)

    # Example 1: Friday Food Delivery Pattern

    OBSERVATION: User spends 40% of food budget on Friday deliveries

    HOMEOSTATIC DIAGNOSIS:
    - SET POINT: R$1,500 food budget
    - DISTURBANCE: Friday stress (metabolic trigger)
    - SENSOR: Weekly spending tracking
    - CORRECTOR: Missing! No automatic intervention

    SOLUTION: Install corrector
    - Pre-order groceries Thursday
    - Schedule Friday meal prep
    - Budget alert at R$1,200 (80% threshold)
    - Alternative reward: Movie instead of food delivery

    # Example 2: Credit Card Debt Spiral

    OBSERVATION: Minimum payments, growing debt

    HOMEOSTATIC FAILURE:
    - Positive feedback loop (debt → stress → spending → debt)
    - No negative feedback corrector

    SOLUTION: Install circuit breaker
    - Freeze credit card
    - Cash-only week
    - Debt snowball method (negative feedback prioritization)

formulas:
  budget_gap: "Gap = Set Point - Current Spending"
  corrector_strength: "Reduction = Gap × Sensitivity"
  feedback_gain: "Gain = Change in Output / Change in Input"
  stability_criterion: "Stable if Feedback Gain < 1.0"

principles:
  - "Budget is a control system, not just a number"
  - "Negative feedback creates stability"
  - "Positive feedback creates instability (vicious cycles)"
  - "Sensor lag causes overshoot"
  - "Set point drift is normal adaptation (not necessarily bad)"
  - "Corrector must be automatic, not willpower-dependent"
  - "Disturbances are inevitable - build buffers"
