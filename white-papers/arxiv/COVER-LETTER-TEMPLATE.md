This paper presents a novel architecture for AGI systems designed for
250-year continuous operation, where software artifacts are conceptualized
as digital organisms. We introduce six integrated subsystems including
code emergence, genetic evolution, O(1) episodic memory, constitutional
AI, behavioral security, and cognitive defense. Implemented across 25,550
lines of code with 93% test coverage, demonstrating 11-70× performance

## Template 3: Announcement Email (Post-Publication)

**Subject**: New Paper: Glass Organism Architecture for AGI

Dear Colleagues,

I'm pleased to announce that our paper on a novel AGI architecture has been published on arXiv:

**Title**: Glass Organism Architecture: A Biological Approach to Artificial General Intelligence

**Authors**: Chomsky Project Consortium

**arXiv ID**: arXiv:2025.XXXXX [cs.AI]

**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.XXXXX

**Abstract**:
We present an architecture for AGI systems designed to operate continuously for 250 years, where software artifacts are conceptualized as digital organisms rather than traditional programs. Our approach integrates six specialized subsystems: Code Emergence, Genetic Evolution, O(1) Episodic Memory, Constitutional AI, Behavioral Security, and Cognitive Defense.

**Key Contributions**:
1. Biological model for AGI architecture (.glass format)
2. Code emergence from knowledge patterns (no explicit programming)
3. O(1) episodic memory with 11-70× performance gains
4. Integrated constitutional AI and behavioral security
5. 250-year longevity mechanisms

**Implementation**:
- 25,550 lines of code across 6 parallel nodes
- 306+ tests with 93% coverage
- Open-source release: [GitHub URL]
- Benchmarks: [Dataset URL]

**Why This Matters**:
This work challenges traditional approaches to AGI by treating software as living organisms, enabling self-evolution, constitutional compliance, and unprecedented longevity. We believe this paradigm shift is essential for safe, reliable AGI systems.

**Resources**:
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.XXXXX

**Thread Format**

🧵 New research: Glass Organism Architecture for AGI 🧬🤖

We're reimagining AGI by treating software as digital organisms. Here's what makes this different:

1/7

---

Instead of programming, we enable CODE EMERGENCE:
- Functions materialize from knowledge patterns
- No explicit coding needed
- 1,847 patterns → 3 functions emerged
- Like proteins folding from DNA

2/7

---

We implemented GENETIC EVOLUTION for code:
- Natural selection on software
- Mutations, crossover, fitness-based survival
- 100 generations: 42% → 87% fitness
- Code that evolves itself

3/7

---

O(1) EPISODIC MEMORY - true constant time:
- 11-70× faster than traditional databases
- Scales to 100M episodes with no slowdown
- Content-addressable storage
- Benchmarks included

4/7

---

CONSTITUTIONAL AI embedded at the core:
- 6 universal principles
- Domain-specific adaptability
- Every decision explainable
- Glass-box transparency

5/7

---

BEHAVIORAL SECURITY + COGNITIVE DEFENSE:
- Biometric authentication (linguistic, typing, emotional)
- 180 manipulation techniques detected
- Chomsky's linguistic hierarchy for analysis
- Protection against psychological attacks

6/7

---

Built for 250 YEARS of continuous operation:
- 25,550 LOC
- 93% test coverage
- 6 parallel development nodes
- Paradigm shift: from engineering to gardening
