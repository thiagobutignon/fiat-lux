## 📄 Published White Papers

### Architecture

#### **WP-011: Glass Organism Architecture**
**Location**: `architecture/WP-011-Glass-Organism-Architecture.md`

**Key Topics**:
- Complete 6-node architecture integration
- Biological analogy (.glass = digital cell)
- Philosophical foundation (3 theses → one truth)
- Production statistics (25,550+ lines of code)
- Performance achievements (O(1) verified)

**Size**: ~18,000 words

### Core Systems

#### **WP-012: Code Emergence & Self-Evolution**
**Location**: `core-systems/WP-012-Code-Emergence-Self-Evolution.md`

**Abstract**: The paradigm shift from programming to gardening—how code emerges from knowledge patterns and evolves through natural selection.

**Key Topics**:
- Code emergence from patterns (ROXO node)
- Genetic evolution & natural selection (VERDE node)
- From manual programming to autonomous improvement
- Performance: 1,050× faster than manual development
- Constitutional safeguards for evolution

**Authors**: CINZA (Cognitive OS Node)

**Metrics**:

#### **WP-014: Behavioral Security Layer**
**Location**: `security/WP-014-Behavioral-Security-Layer.md`

**Abstract**: Security based on WHO you ARE (behavior), not WHAT you KNOW (passwords)—impossible to steal, detects duress.

**Key Topics**:
- Linguistic fingerprinting (vocabulary, syntax, semantics, sentiment)
- Typing/interaction patterns (keystroke dynamics)
- Emotional signature (VAD model: Valence-Arousal-Dominance)
- Temporal patterns (when you interact)
- Multi-signal duress detection
- Constitutional integration (Layer 1 + Layer 2)

**Authors**: VERMELHO (Security/Behavioral Node)

**Metrics**:
- Anomaly Detection: 96.7% precision, 3.3% FPR
- Duress Detection: 94% TP, 2% FP
- Performance: O(1) updates, <5ms per interaction

**Size**: ~16,000 words

### Coordination

#### **6-Node Status Report**
**Location**: `coordination/6-NODES-STATUS.md`

**Abstract**: Executive summary of all 6 nodes' progress, statistics, and integration status.

**Key Topics**:
- Complete status of ROXO, VERDE, LARANJA, AZUL, VERMELHO, CINZA
- Production statistics (code, tests, performance)
- Philosophical convergence (.glass = digital cell)
- Next steps (immediate, medium-term, long-term)

**Size**: ~5,000 words

## 🔬 Philosophical Foundation

### The Three Validated Theses

**1. "Você Não Sabe é Tudo" (Not Knowing is Everything)**
- Epistemic humility: Start empty (0% knowledge)
- Learn from domain, specialization emerges organically

**2. "Ócio é Tudo" (Idleness is Everything)**
- Lazy evaluation: On-demand, auto-organization
- O(1) efficiency: No wasted computation

**3. "Um Código é Tudo" (One Code is Everything)**
- Self-contained organism: Model + code + memory + constitution
- 100% portable, self-evolving

**Convergence**: `.glass` = Digital Cell (not software, LIFE)

## 🧬 Biological Analogy

```
Biological Cell              Digital Cell (.glass)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DNA (genetic code)        →  .gl code (executable)
RNA (messenger)           →  knowledge (mutable)
Proteins (function)       →  emerged functions
Membrane (boundary)       →  constitutional AI
Mitochondria (energy)     →  runtime engine
Ribosome (synthesis)      →  code emergence
Lysosome (cleanup)        →  old-but-gold
Cellular memory           →  episodic memory (.sqlo)
Metabolism                →  self-evolution
Replication               →  cloning/reproduction
Immune system             →  behavioral security
Cognitive function        →  manipulation detection

Lifecycle: Birth (0%) → Learning → Code Emergence → Evolution → Reproduction → Death → Old-but-gold

But: 100% Glass Box (transparent, auditable, constitutional)
```
