**Minimum Responsible Handling (MRH) Standards**:
- Max 10% net workforce displacement per year
- Phased implementation for changes affecting >5% of workforce
- Documented retraining/transition plans
- Quarterly impact audits

### 3.2 Revenue Sharing Based on Impact

Commercial users must contribute to Social Impact Fund:

| Workforce Impact | Annual Fee |

| Net neutral or positive (WIA > 0) | Base license fee only |
| 1-5% displacement | Base + 5% of automation savings |
| 5-10% displacement | Base + 15% of automation savings |
| >10% displacement | **License suspended - requires remediation** |

**Example**:
- Company automates processes saving $1M/year
- Results in 50 job eliminations (8% of workforce)
- Fee: Base ($50K) + 15% of $1M = **$200K/year**

## 13. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

This license embodies three principles:

1. **"You Don't Know Is All You Need"**
   We don't know all impacts of AGI deployment. Therefore, mandatory monitoring and humility.

2. **"Idleness Is All You Need"**
   Efficiency gains should create leisure, not unemployment. Cost savings must benefit workers.

3. **"Continuous Evolution Is All You Need"**
   Standards will evolve as we learn. This license adapts to emerging best practices.

**Core Belief**: AGI that reduces costs by 95% should not concentrate wealth by 95%. It should distribute prosperity.

---

## ACCEPTANCE

By using this software commercially, you agree to these terms in their entirety.

**Signature Required**: Enterprise deployments must submit signed agreement.

---

**License Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: October 2025
**Legal Review**: Pending

---

*This license is designed to prevent AGI from being used as a tool of workforce displacement without accountability. It's an experiment in responsible innovation - feedback welcome.*
