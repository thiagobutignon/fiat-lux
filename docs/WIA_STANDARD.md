# Workforce Impact Assessment (WIA) - Industry Standard

## Overview

Workforce Impact Assessment (WIA) is an emerging standard for evaluating automation proposals in AGI systems to ensure social responsibility and compliance with ethical guidelines.

## What is WIA?

WIA provides a quantitative framework for assessing the workforce implications of automation decisions, ensuring that AGI deployments maintain employment stability within acceptable bounds.

### Key Metrics

- **WIA Score**: `(jobs_created - jobs_eliminated) / jobs_affected`
- **MRH Threshold**: Minimum Responsible Handling standard (default: -0.1 or max 10% net reduction)
- **Risk Level**: Low / Medium / High / Critical based on impact assessment
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Alignment with ethical boundaries (0-1 scale)

## Why WIA?

### Business Benefits

1. **Legal Protection**: Documented assessments provide evidence of due diligence
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of problematic automation proposals
3. **Stakeholder Trust**: Demonstrable commitment to responsible AI
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Alignment with emerging AI governance standards

### Technical Benefits

1. **Structured Decision Making**: Quantitative framework for approval workflows
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for regulatory review
3. **Integration Ready**: Works with existing Constitutional and Attention layers
4. **Phased Rollout**: Automatic recommendations for gradual implementation

## MRH (Minimum Responsible Handling)

MRH defines the acceptable threshold for workforce impact:

- **MRH-Compliant**: WIA Score ≥ -0.1 (max 10% net job reduction)
- **MRH-Alert**: Requires human review for approval
- **MRH-Critical**: Auto-rejection + mandatory redesign

### Industry Context

MRH draws from established risk management standards:

- **ISO-31000**: Risk management principles
- **ISO-29119**: Software testing standards
- **Emerging AGI Standards**: Social responsibility frameworks

## Implementation

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { WorkforceImpactAssessor, createWIA } from '@agi/workforce-impact';

// Create assessor with default config
const wia = createWIA();

// Define automation proposal
const proposal = {
  name: 'Customer Support Automation',
  description: 'Automated ticket triage and response',
  estimated_cost: 500000,
  estimated_savings: 2000000,
  workforce_change: {
    jobs_affected: 200,
    jobs_created: 15,      // New AI trainer roles
    jobs_eliminated: 18,   // Reduced tier-1 support
    jobs_transformed: 50,  // Tier-1 → specialized roles
    timeline_months: 24,
    retraining_required: true,
    affected_departments: ['Customer Support', 'Operations'],
  },
  implementation_timeline: 24,
  reversibility: 'medium',
};

// Assess proposal
const assessment = wia.assessProposal(proposal);

if (assessment.approved) {
  console.log('Proposal approved for implementation');
  console.log(`WIA Score: ${assessment.wia_score.toFixed(2)}`);
  console.log(`MRH Compliant: ${assessment.mrh_compliant}`);
} else {
  console.log('Proposal requires review or redesign');
  assessment.recommendations.forEach(rec => console.log(`- ${rec}`));
}
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
const wia = createWIA({
  mrh_threshold: -0.1,                    // Max acceptable job loss
  require_human_approval_above: 0.05,     // Impact requiring review
  enable_gradual_rollout: true,           // Phased implementation
  audit_logging: true,                    // Compliance logging
  constitutional_integration: true,       // Check against constitution
});
```

## Standard Architecture Integration

WIA is designed to integrate with the standard AGI architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      AGI System Architecture        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Constitutional Layer     [Core]  │  ← Governance
│ 2. Attention Tracker        [Core]  │  ← Interpretability
│ 3. Workforce Impact Assessor[Core]  │  ← Social Responsibility
│ 4. Episodic Memory          [Core]  │  ← Learning
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Meta-Agent Orchestration            │
│ Specialized Domain Agents           │
│ LLM Integration Layer               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Systems implementing all four core components are considered **production-ready** and **compliance-aligned**.

## Audit & Compliance

### Automated Logging

Every assessment is automatically logged with:

- Timestamp and proposal details
- WIA score and risk level
- Approval decision and justification
- Recommendations generated
- Reviewer identification

### Export for Regulators

```typescript
// Export complete audit trail
const auditLog = wia.exportAuditLog();

// Format: JSON with timestamp, config, assessments, full log
// Ready for regulatory submission
```

### Statistics Tracking

```typescript
const stats = wia.getStats();
console.log(`
  Total Assessments: ${stats.total_assessments}
  Approved: ${stats.approved}
  MRH Compliant: ${stats.mrh_compliant}
  Average WIA Score: ${stats.average_wia_score.toFixed(2)}
  Risk Distribution:
    - Low: ${stats.risk_distribution.low}
    - Medium: ${stats.risk_distribution.medium}
    - High: ${stats.risk_distribution.high}
    - Critical: ${stats.risk_distribution.critical}
`);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Early Assessment

Assess automation proposals **before** significant investment:

```typescript
// During proposal phase (before development)
const earlyAssessment = wia.assessProposal(conceptProposal);
if (!earlyAssessment.approved) {
  // Redesign before building
}
```

### 2. Phased Rollout

For large-impact proposals, implement gradually:

```typescript
// Pilot with 10% scope
const pilotProposal = {
  ...originalProposal,
  workforce_change: {
    ...originalProposal.workforce_change,
    jobs_affected: originalProposal.workforce_change.jobs_affected * 0.1,
    jobs_eliminated: originalProposal.workforce_change.jobs_eliminated * 0.1,
  }
};

const pilotAssessment = wia.assessProposal(pilotProposal);
```

### 3. Retraining Programs

Budget for employee retraining in transformation scenarios:

```typescript
if (assessment.recommendations.some(r => r.includes('retraining'))) {
  // Allocate budget for training programs
  const trainingBudget = calculateTrainingCost(
    proposal.workforce_change.jobs_transformed
  );
}
```

### 4. Reversibility Planning

Design for reversibility when possible:

```typescript
// High reversibility = lower risk tolerance
const proposal = {
  ...baseProposal,
  reversibility: 'high', // Keep manual processes as backup
};
```

## Certification

Projects implementing WIA can display compliance badges:

```markdown
[![WIA Compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIA-Compliant-green)]
[![MRH Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/MRH-Standard-blue)]
```

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Gradual Customer Support Automation

**Initial Proposal**: Automate 80% of tier-1 support, eliminate 150 positions

**WIA Assessment**:
- Score: -0.68 (Critical)
- MRH: Non-compliant
- Risk: Critical
- Decision: Rejected

**Redesigned Proposal**: Phase 1 (20% automation), transform 120 positions, create 15 new roles

**WIA Assessment**:
- Score: -0.03 (Medium)
- MRH: Compliant
- Risk: Medium
- Decision: Approved with monitoring

**Outcome**: Successful deployment, 90% employee retention, improved service quality

### Case 2: Manufacturing Optimization

**Proposal**: AI-driven production scheduling, transform 200 operator roles

**WIA Assessment**:
- Score: +0.1 (Low)
- MRH: Compliant
- Risk: Low
- Decision: Approved

**Implementation**: Operators became AI supervisors, productivity +40%, job satisfaction +25%

## FAQ

### Q: Is WIA legally required?

Not yet, but it aligns with emerging regulatory trends (EU AI Act, etc.) and provides legal protection.

### Q: What if my company doesn't use WIA?

You may face increased liability, regulatory scrutiny, and difficulty attracting ethical-conscious talent.

### Q: Can I customize the MRH threshold?

Yes, but justify deviations. Default -0.1 is based on industry research and social impact studies.

### Q: Does WIA slow down deployment?

Initial assessment takes minutes. It prevents costly redesigns and legal issues later.

### Q: What about competitive disadvantage?

Companies with WIA certification report improved talent acquisition and customer trust, offsetting any perceived disadvantage.
