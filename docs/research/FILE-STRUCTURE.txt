Key Differences: Before vs After
=================================

BEFORE (Optimistic/Naive):
- Focus: 90% tech, 10% politics
- Strategy: Bitcoin fork, voluntary crypto adoption
- Scale: 100M users in 5 years
- Budget: $4M in 18 months
- Promise: "Blockchain solves inequality"

AFTER (Realistic/Honest):
- Focus: 70% politics, 20% pilot, 10% transparency
- Strategy: Lobby for AI Tax legislation
- Scale: 100 users (pilot) → 1M via law in 10 years
- Budget: $1.5M over 5 years
- Truth: "Politics solves inequality, tech enables transparency"

Next Steps
==========

THIS WEEK:
□ Read pragmatic docs
□ Decide: Option A (pilot + advocacy) or B (100% advocacy)
□ Present to stakeholders
□ Get feedback from economists/politicians

MONTH 1-3:
□ If A: Setup tech (Stripe + PostgreSQL, not blockchain)
□ If B: Write policy paper (50+ pages)
□ Start conversations with legislators
□ Build coalition (NGOs, unions)

YEAR 1-10:
□ Relentless political advocacy
□ Build social movement
□ Measure legislative progress
□ AI Tax passed in 1+ country = SUCCESS

Status: Ready for Decision
