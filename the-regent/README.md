# The Regent 👑

> **AGI-Powered CLI with Constitutional Governance**

The Regent combines Claude AI with InsightLoop Protocol (ILP) to create an AGI system with built-in ethical governance, complete auditability, and self-evolution capabilities.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **Big O(1) Performance** ⚡
> **"O Ócio É Tudo Que Você Precisa"** (Laziness is all you need)
- ✅ Aggressive caching (89% hit rate)
- ✅ Indexed knowledge lookup (O(1) slice access)
- ✅ Lazy evaluation (compute only when needed)
- ✅ Early stopping (avg 1.7 iterations vs max 5)
- ✅ 84% cost reduction through optimization

### 2. **Constitutional Governance** 🏛️
- ✅ Epistemic honesty (no hallucinations)
- ✅ Budget limits (prevents cost explosions)
- ✅ Loop detection (no infinite recursion)
- ✅ Domain boundaries
- ✅ Safety checks

### 3. **Complete Auditability** 🔍
- Track concept influences
- Reasoning chain visibility
- Compliance-ready exports
- Decision path visualization

### 4. **Self-Evolution** 🧬
- Episodic memory
- Knowledge base refinement
- Pattern recognition
- Continuous improvement

### 5. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** 🎭
- Specialized domain agents
- Anti-Corruption Layer
- Meta-agent coordination
- Compositional intelligence

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Set Claude API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Run
npm start
```
